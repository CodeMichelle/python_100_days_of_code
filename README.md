# python_100_days_of_code
This is the repository for my Python 100 days of Code Udemy coursework. 

I have decided to start this journey in an effort to expand my Python knowledge. At work I am currently only coding in Python, but had to pick it up quickly and was never taught the fundamentals of the language which seems to get in the way of progress at times. I am excited to learn more about Python and look forward to coding and creating a new app every day!
